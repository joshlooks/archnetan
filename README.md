The goal of archnetan is to make network analysis of archaeological
artifacts easier! It provides functions to analyse the similarity
between different artifact ‘features’ and detect network communities
between them.

## Installation

You can install the development version of archnetan from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nesaking100/archnetan")
```

## Example

This is a basic example of how to generate an example network (using
data from Ahuahu Great Mercury Island in New Zealand):

``` r
library(archnetan)
## basic example code
```
